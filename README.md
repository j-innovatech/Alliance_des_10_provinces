# Alliance_des_10_provinces
The 10-Province Alliance was a 19th century association of salt producers from around the Seto Inland Sea in Japan. The alliance was a sort of salt-makers' confederation. The work on this project takes place within J-InnovaTech project, Principal Investigator Aleksandra Kobiljski (CNRS) and focuses on actors of early Japan’s industry, with special attention to  production of basic goods such as salt. Project has focused on meetings of salt producers between 1815 and 1866. 
The research, data wrangling and code production for this project were funded by the European Research Council (ERC) as part of the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program  (GA no. 805098).

This repository stores three types of files. The json files are exported from J-innovatech database on Heurist. Python code cleans and wrangles the data in these json files to obtain a CSV file for further analysis. Then the CSV file is the end result of this data processing.
