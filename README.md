# Salt_Alliance
Repository for the project "Alliance of the 10 domains" at the ERC J-Innovatech project.

This repository stores three types of files. The json files are exported from J-innovatech database on Heurist. Python code cleans and wrangles the data in these json files to obtain a CSV file for further analysis. Then the CSV file is the end result of this data processing.
